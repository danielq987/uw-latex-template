Git was developed by the Linux team in 2005 in order to aid with kernel development.
As this was such a large project, a fast and efficient version control system was desired.
According to Google Trends and unofficial sources, it is also by far the most commonly used Version Control System used today \cite{vcs-stats}\cite{vcs-google-trends}.
