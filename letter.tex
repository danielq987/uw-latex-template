As we agreed, I have prepared the enclosed report, “LAN in the Workplace,” for my 2A work report and for the Internal Computer Support Department. This report, the third of four work reports that the Co-operative Education Program
requires that I successfully complete as part of my BMath Co-op degree
requirements, has not received academic credit.

The Internal Computer Support team that you lead provides LAN and hardware
support to internal users. My job as LAN Support Assistant required that I
handle all requests for support regarding the network. I responded to telephone, e-mail, and in-person queries. This report is an in-depth study of the implementation of the company’s new Local Area Network. 

The Faculty of Mathematics requests that you evaluate this report for command of topic and technical content/analysis. Following your assessment, the report, together with your evaluation, will be submitted to the Math Undergrad Office for evaluation on campus by qualified work report markers. The combined marks determine whether the report will receive credit and whether it will be
considered for an award.

Thank you for your assistance in preparing this report.
